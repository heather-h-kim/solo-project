Kitty Weight Watcher

## Description

This app calculates recommended daily calories and feeding amounts for cats to stay at a healthy weight. Users can add their cat(s) and edit the cat's profile. When the users enter their cat's age, neuter status and goal weight, the app calculates the recommended daily calories for the cat. Then when the user enters food information the app calculates suggested feeding amounts based on the recommended daily calories. The feeding amounts are calculated for up to two foods - wet food and dry food. The users may select wet food only or dry food only, or both wet food and dry food. The users also can track their cat's weight history in the Chart page. In addition, if the calculated daily calories do not work for their cat(s) the users can adjust the recommended daily calories.
